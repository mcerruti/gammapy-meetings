# Gammapy Co-Working Week, November 2020

Instead of the autumn coding sprint we have another "Gammapy co-working week" from Nov 23rd to 27th 2020.
Ideally all participants can dedicate most of their time to work on Gammapy during the week and make sure
they are available for spontaneous discussions on Slack and remote meetings via Zoom. 

A Zoom room is open for the full week. ID: 837 3792 5932

The password will be given on Slack (#dev channel).

In between communication via Slack: https://gammapy.slack.com (#dev channel)

For this co-working week we will put a string focus on documentation!

### General coding projects (no particular order...):


#### General
- Finish open PRs: https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A0.18
- Prototype for real time analysis?

#### Documenation
- Move API tutorials to the corresponding sub-packages and build "in place"
- Simplify data download: remove index files and use a single tar file instead?
- Simplify notebook download: remove index files and use a single tar file at the top of the tutorials page instead?
- Resolve content duplication between tutorials / RST 
- Write RST pages for new sub-packages (Axel, Régis)
- Add documentation on `RegionGeom` and `RegionNDMap` (Axel)
- Further improve IRF documentation
- User contributed notebooks?

#### Validation and testing
- Update and finish validation of DR1-DL3, CTA 1DC, 3FHL etc.
- Move CI setup to github workflows?

#### API
- Merge `SpectrumDataset` and `MapDataset`?
- Make `Fit` class configurable, so that users can choose backends for flux points estimation.
- Remove support for `EDispKernel` in `MapDataset`
- Remove `BackgroundModel` and support the use case via `TemplateSpatialModel`?

#### Features
- Model management functionality, such as `Models.select()` and `Parameters.freeze(type="spatial")`, lets 
- Unified flux points handling (see PIG 22)
- Implement `EDispEnergyScaleModel`?

#### Bugs and Fixes
- TBD

### Discussion topics:
- Model book-keeping in `MapDataset.to_image()`, `MapDataset.to_spectrum_dataset()` etc. methods. Should we rely on `.npred_background()`?
